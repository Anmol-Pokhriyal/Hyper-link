  <p class="write">Undergraduate education is where careers begin. UG degree programs are supposed to skill students personally and
    professionally and make them industry-ready. But, they are miserably failing. As a start to solving this problem,
    <a href="https://kalvieducation.com/"> Kalvi</a>
    is completely reimagining <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology">technology</a> degree programs. By leveraging <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology">technology</a> and a well-rounded curriculum,
    Kalvi aims to nurture future CTOs, CEOs, and Tech Entrepreneurs of the world.

  <p class="write2">Kalvi is a disruptive edtech company, with a mission to transform the future of higher education in technology. Kalvi supercharges the traditional computer engineering degree construct using their proprietary and cutting-edge
    instructional design called 'Quadrangle'. This learning management ecosystem integrates work as a part of the program along with liberal courses, to offer (4 years fully residential) World's First Liberal Engineering program, in partnership with
    universities and institutions of eminence.

    <a href="learningModels.html">Kalvi's learning model</a> is a convergence of the latest technology curriculum, a liberal outlook on engineering, and a real-world work experience. The instructional design (Quadrangle) is built to map the end-to-end learning footprint of the
    students by teaching them the how, focussing on the why, and constructing, deconstructing, and reconstructing based on the whole game teaching methodology. The quadrangle is built on four main pillars namely the academic core, skilling core, work
    integration, and analytics.
    </br>
    With a market-fit learning pedagogy, Kalvi instead of atypical chalk and talk class lectures provide students on-site learning. Through this, they can learn on the job, come back, have robust dialogue and discussions with peers and professors,
    which gives them the ability to challenge preconceived hypotheses and theories and think creatively.
    </br>
    The courses are selected carefully and approved by an academic council comprising of leading professors from various global institutions and whetted by an Industry Advisory Board consisting of experts from the technology industry.
